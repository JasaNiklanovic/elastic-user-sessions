## ElasticSearch experiment with Docker - collecting fake user sessions

These are two simple applications that do following things:

* `elastic-stack` demonstrates usage of Elasticsearch along with Kibana; "docker-compose up"
* `search` demonstrates usage of Elasticsearch for data querying; "node index.js, npm test"

* `search/import` run node sessions.js && node.identities.js to populate your Elasticsearch instance with data
